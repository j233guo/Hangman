********** Game Rules **********
In this game you are going to guess some words from a word bank of your choice.

1. The word you are going to guess is initially presented as a row of dashes representing letters.

2. Each time you can take a guess by entering a letter that is available.
    * If you suggest a letter that presents in the word, then it will become 'guessed' and shown. The game will
      then prompt you to take a next guess.
    * If you suggest a letter that does not present in the words, then the game will draw one element of a hanged man
      stick figure.
    * Used letters cannot be used again.
    * If the hanged man figure is completely drawn (used up your chances) the game is over.

3. In each level you have 10 chances. If you take a wrong guess you lose 1.

4. This game has 5 levels, you can only pass it by completing all 5 levels. Failure in any level will end the game.
